### Screenshots

![Web](screenshots/screen-web.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.
